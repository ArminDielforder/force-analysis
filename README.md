Raw data for Figs. 2 and 3 in Dielforder et al. (submitted)

Stress_solutions: First column is depth (m), second column is mean shear stress (Pa), third column is the standard deviation of the mean (Pa).

Shear_force_solutions: Model solutions for the shear force (TN/m).

TSE_solutions: Model solutions for the tectonically supported elevation (m).
